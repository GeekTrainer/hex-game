    <h1>Hexagon Game</h1>
    <p>
        The Hexagon Game is a strategy game where players take turns attempting to create a triangle between the points on the hexagonal grid. The first person to complete a triangle is the winner.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game alternates between players, and the first player to complete a winning triangle is declared the winner. When it's a player's turn, they select one point then another to draw their line. Once a line is drawn, it cannot be used again. The triangles which "count" are ones which connect three points from the hexagon grid, not just any three points on the canvas.
